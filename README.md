# Supply-Chain-Analysis-Excel
**End-to-end Supply Chain analysis using Excel Power Query and Pivot Tables to identify shipping variances, OTIF (On-Time In-Full) failures, and profit leaks in global retail operations.**
---
## 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to transform raw shipment data into actionable business insights. By focusing on **Shipping Variances**, **OTIF (On-Time In-Full)** reliability, and **Profit Leaks**, this analysis provides a roadmap for increasing operational efficiency and protecting company margins.

## 🛠️ Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Architecture & Cleaning
* Processed over **180,000 rows** of DataCo shipment data using **Excel Power Query**.
* Standardized naming conventions and handled missing values in financial columns.
* Selected key metrics: `Order Profit Per Order`, `Order Item Profit Ratio`, and `Days for Shipping`.

### Phase 2: Operational KPI Development
* **Shipping Variance:** Created custom logic to calculate the gap between scheduled vs. actual delivery days.
* **OTIF Status:** Developed a binary classification (On-Time / Late) to measure vendor and carrier reliability.

### Phase 3: Profit Leak Detection
* Isolated transactions with **negative profit** using Conditional Formatting and Filter Logic.
* Identified "Leaky" categories where logistics costs outweighed the product's selling price.
* Analyzed the relationship between **Shipping Mode** and margin erosion.

### Phase 4: Executive Dashboard (In Progress)
* Building a dynamic visual interface using **Pivot Charts** and **Slicers**.
* Creating regional deep-dives to visualize where "Profit Leaks" are most frequent.

## 📊 Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Advanced Excel:** Power Query (ETL), Logical Functions (IF/IFS), XLOOKUP, Data Modeling.
* **Business Intelligence:** Root Cause Analysis, KPI Scorecarding, Margin Analysis.
* **Project Management:** Documentation via GitHub and version control.
